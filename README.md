# Koehandel ActionScript project

This is an old project that I initially developed back in early 2014.

## Running the code

Download the latest AIR SDK: https://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html (tested with 32.0).

And for editing I recommend using the open source Flash IDE:
https://www.flashdevelop.org/

See `bat` directory for scripts that run (on Windows) the application. RunApp.bat should work.

## Warning

The code quality is hideous, explained by my lack of experience as I was just starting out.

## Licensing

I don't own any rights to the images or game so figuring out legal usage of those assets is your own responsibility.
